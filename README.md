# Abstraction function and rep invariant 

Implementation of abstraction function and rep invariant.

## How does it work? 

Abstract Concept of a queue of distinct strings:
A queue of distinct strings, p, is a collection of strings with a front and end where a string cannot exist more than once in the collection. For example, the collection of strings {“ab”, “cd”, “ae”, “bd”} is a queue with front = “ab” and end = “bd”. The only operations supported are addition of a string at the end known as enqueue, and deletion of a string from the front known as dequeue.     

The following is accomplished:    
<ul>
  <li>The abstraction function in the Overview clause.</li>
  <li>The rep invariant in the Overview clause.</li>
  <li>The method repOK().</li>
  <li>The method toString().</li>
</ul>
